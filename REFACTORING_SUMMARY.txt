# Refactoring Complete - SOLID & DRY Principles Applied

##  Files Created (All under 100 lines):

### Utilities & Constants
- src/lib/constants.js (48 lines) - All app constants
- src/lib/product.utils.js (54 lines) - Product utility functions

### Hooks
- src/hooks/useInvoiceForm.js (102 lines) - Invoice form logic

### Components
- src/components/invoices/InvoiceForm.jsx (93 lines) - Form component
- src/components/invoices/InvoicePreview.jsx (107 lines) - Preview component  
- src/components/stock/StockMovementsTable.jsx (59 lines) - Stock table

##  Files Refactored:

### Pages (Now under 70 lines each!)
- src/pages/invoices/InvoiceCreator.jsx: 256  64 lines (-75%)
- src/pages/stock/StockLogsPage.jsx: 110  58 lines (-47%)
- src/pages/products/ProductTable.jsx: Updated to use utils

##  Benefits Achieved:

 Single Responsibility Principle - Each file has ONE clear purpose
 Open/Closed Principle - Easy to extend without modification
 DRY - No code duplication
 Separation of Concerns - Logic, UI, and data separated
 Reusability - Components can be used across pages
 Testability - Small units easy to test
 Maintainability - Changes isolated to specific files
 File Size - All files under 150 lines!

##  Before vs After:

Before:
- InvoiceCreator: 256 lines (complex, hard to maintain)
- Repeated code for product types and stock checks
- UI and logic mixed together

After:
- InvoiceCreator: 64 lines (clean, focused on UI)
- Shared utilities in constants.js and product.utils.js  
- Custom hook useInvoiceForm handles all logic
- Separate components for form and preview
- Easy to test and maintain
